# Check Installed Linux Versions (Debian-based Distributions)

Check Installed Linux Versions and list old versions to remove.
Code is set to keep at least the newest version and also to keet the version from meta-package (linux-generic-image).

## #TODO

* Option to change number of version to keep.
* Implement Program Arguments for that.
* Clear code.
